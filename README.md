# AquaSense: Intelligent Water Level Monitoring System

## 📄 Overview

**AquaSense** is an intelligent water level monitoring system developed as a lab project for the *Digital Logic Design Lab (CSE 204)* at **Green University of Bangladesh**. It uses sensors and microcontroller-based circuits to monitor water levels in real-time, offering an efficient and cost-effective solution for applications like household water tanks, reservoirs, or flood alert systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor water levels in real time using simple sensor circuits.
- Alert users when water reaches specific high or low levels.
- Reduce water overflow and underutilization using an efficient monitoring setup.
- Create a low-cost and energy-efficient system using basic electronics.

---
## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Real-Time Monitoring** – Measures water levels using electronic sensors continuously.
- 🚨 **Threshold-Based Alerts** – Triggers warnings when water crosses predefined safe levels.
- 🔋 **Energy Efficient** – Operates with minimal power consumption.
- 📦 **Compact & Cost-Effective** – Built with widely available components.
- 📟 **Customizable Interface** – Outputs data to a display or external monitoring system.

## ⚙️ Components Used

- ✅ **Water Level Sensor** (metal probes or float sensors)
- ✅ **Transistors** (e.g., BC547)
- ✅ **LEDs** (for level indication)
- ✅ **Resistors**
- ✅ **Buzzer** (for alert)
- ✅ **Power Supply** (5V or 9V battery)
- ✅ **Breadboard** or PCB
- ✅ **Connecting Wires**

## 🛠️ Circuit Description

- The circuit uses **metal probes** at various heights to detect water levels.
- When water touches a probe, it completes the circuit and turns on the corresponding **LED**.
- A **buzzer** sounds when the tank is full (or empty, based on setup).
- The system is **fully analog**, requiring **no microcontroller or programming**.

> 📄 Detailed circuit diagram is available in the `docs/circuit_diagram.pdf` file.

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Assemble the circuit on a breadboard or PCB as per the diagram.
2. Insert the metal probes into the water tank.
3. Connect power supply (battery or adapter).
4. Observe the **LED indicators** and **buzzer alerts** as water levels change.
